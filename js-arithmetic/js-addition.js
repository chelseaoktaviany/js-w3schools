// arithmetic operators
/*
    A typical arithmetic operation operates on two numbers.
    The two numbers can be literals:
*/

// let x = 100 + 50;

//or variables:

// let x = a + b;

//or expressions:

// let x = (100 + 50) * a;

//addition
// the addition operator (+) adds the numbers

let x = 5;
let y = 2;

let z = x + y;

console.log(z);
