// javascript has only one type of numbers
// numbers can be written with, or without decimals
let x1 = 34.0; // written with decimals
let x2 = 34; // written without decimals

// extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponential) notation:
let x = 123e5; // 12300000
let z = 123e-5; // 0.00123
