// it is a common practice to declare arrays with the const keyword
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

//spaces and line breaks are not important. a declaration can span multiple lines
const cars2 = [
    "Saab", 
    "Volvo", 
    "BMW"
];

//you can also create an array, then provide the elements
const cars3 = [];
cars3[0] = "Saab";
cars3[1] = "Volvo";
cars3[2] = "BMW";
