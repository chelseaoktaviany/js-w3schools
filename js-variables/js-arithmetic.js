//as with algebra, you can do arithmetic with JS variables, using operators like = and +:
let x = 5 + 2 + 3;
console.log(x); //10

//you can also add strings, but strings will be concatenated:
let y = "John" + " " + "Doe";
console.log(y); //John Doe

//also try this:
let z = "5" + 2 + 3;
console.log(z); //523

//if you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings and concatenated.
let a = 2 + 3 + "5";
console.log(a); //55
