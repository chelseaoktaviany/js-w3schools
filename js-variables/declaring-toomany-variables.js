//you can declare many variables in one statement.
//start the statement with let and separate the variables by comma:
let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;

/*
A declaration can span multiple lines:
let person = "John Doe",
    carName = "Volvo",
    price = 200;
*/

//prints the result
console.log(person + ", " + carName + ", " + price); //John Doe, Volvo, 200
